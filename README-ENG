🎯 General Goal

To develop a model for the automated identification of operators considered ineffective within the CallMeMaybe platform.

🧩 Methodology

 - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Definition of Ineffectiveness Metrics (missed call rate, volume of outgoing calls)
 - Hypothesis Testing

☘️ Expected Results

 - A clear set of quantifiable criteria to define operator "ineffectiveness."
 - A prioritized list of operators displaying the worst performance indicators according to the defined KPIs.
 - An interactive dashboard allowing supervisors to monitor performance in near real-time.
 - Statistically significant conclusions that support or refute the initial hypotheses regarding operator behavior.

📑 Obtained Results

 - Classification of operators based on missed call rate.
 - Relationship between missed call rate and wait time for each operator.
 - The null hypothesis is rejected, as it has been demonstrated that operators with a higher number of missed calls have significantly longer wait times than operators with fewer missed calls.
