# Inefficient Operator Identification System for CallMeMaybe Virtual Telephony Service

This capstone project involves developing a comprehensive operator performance evaluation system for CallMeMaybe virtual telephony service. The goal is to identify inefficient operators through data analysis and provide supervisors with actionable insights to improve call center operations and customer service quality.

**Business Context**
Company: CallMeMaybe - Virtual telephony service provider
Service Model: Call distribution platform for organizations managing high-volume incoming calls and outbound calling campaigns
Business Challenge: Need for automated identification of underperforming operators to optimize call center efficiency
Target Users: Call center supervisors and operations managers

**Problem Definition**
Inefficient Operator Criteria:
- High Missed Call Rate: Excessive number of missed incoming calls (both internal and external)
- Extended Wait Times: Prolonged waiting periods for incoming calls
- Low Outbound Activity: Insufficient outbound calling volume (for operators assigned to outbound duties)

**Analytical Methodology**
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Understand call patterns, operator behavior, and service performance metrics

Data Exploration Components:
- Call Volume Analysis: Distribution of calls across operators, time periods, and directions
- Performance Metrics: Calculate missed call rates, average wait times, and call duration statistics
- Temporal Patterns: Identify peak calling periods and seasonal variations
- Operator Productivity: Analyze individual operator performance across multiple dimensions

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Missed Call Rate: Percentage of incoming calls not answered by each operator
- Average Wait Time: Mean waiting duration for incoming calls per operator
- Outbound Call Volume: Number of outgoing calls initiated by each operator
- Call Efficiency Ratio: Relationship between call duration and total call duration

2. Inefficient Operator Identification
Multi-Criteria Performance Assessment:
Primary Inefficiency Indicators:

Missed Call Analysis:
- Calculate individual operator missed call percentages
- Compare against service benchmarks and peer performance
- Separate analysis for internal vs. external missed calls

Wait Time Evaluation:
- Compute average wait times per operator for incoming calls
- Identify operators with consistently high wait times
- Analyze wait time trends over different time periods

Outbound Performance Assessment:
- Measure outbound call volumes for operators assigned to outbound duties
- Identify operators with below-average outbound activity
- Correlate outbound performance with role expectations

Composite Performance Scoring:
- Weighted Performance Index: Combine multiple inefficiency metrics into unified score
- Percentile Rankings: Position operators relative to peer performance
- Threshold Analysis: Define performance thresholds for inefficient operator classification

3. Statistical Hypothesis Testing
Objective: Validate findings with statistical rigor and ensure reliable operator performance assessments
Hypothesis Testing Framework:

Performance Comparison Tests: Compare individual operators against team averages
Temporal Consistency Testing: Verify that poor performance is consistent over time
Statistical Significance: Ensure identified inefficiencies are not due to random variation

Potential Statistical Tests:
- T-tests: Compare operator performance means against benchmarks
- Chi-square Tests: Analyze categorical performance distributions
- ANOVA: Compare performance across multiple operator groups
- Time Series Analysis: Assess performance trends and seasonality

**Dashboard Development**
Dashboard 1: Call Duration & Direction Analysis
Components:
- Call Duration Histogram: Distribution of call lengths to identify patterns
- Call Type Distribution: Pie chart showing internal vs. external call proportions
- Interactive Filtering: Call direction filter (inbound/outbound) for dynamic analysis

Business Value: Understand call patterns and optimize resource allocation

Dashboard 2: Daily Call Volume & Activity Analysis
Components:
- Daily Call Volume Histogram: Distribution of calls per day showing workload patterns
- Internal/External Call Breakdown: Pie chart showing call type proportions
- Interactive Filtering: Call type filter (internal/external) for focused analysis

Business Value: Monitor daily operational patterns and identify peak demand periods

**Expected Deliverables**
1. Performance Analysis Report

Inefficient Operator List: Ranked list of underperforming operators with specific metrics
Performance Benchmarks: Service standards and comparative analysis
Trend Analysis: Temporal patterns in operator performance

2. Statistical Validation
- Hypothesis Test Results: Statistical evidence supporting performance assessments
- Confidence Intervals: Reliability measures for performance metrics
- Significance Testing: Validation that identified issues are statistically meaningful

3. Interactive Dashboards
- Real-time Monitoring: Visual dashboards for ongoing operator performance tracking
- Drill-down Capabilities: Detailed analysis tools for supervisors
- Alert Systems: Automated notifications for performance threshold breaches

4. Strategic Recommendations
- Training Priorities: Identification of operators requiring performance improvement
- Process Optimization: Suggestions for improving call handling efficiency
- Resource Allocation: Data-driven recommendations for workforce management

**Business Impact**
